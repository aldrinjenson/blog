      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an exam today. It wak okay, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what this post is about. This post is about the world we live in. Not the physical one with houses, trees, buildings and college, but the one which is more subtle and often times a bit hard to identify, the one filled with people, friends, laughter, rainbows and dewdrops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say about some people whose actions have really had a deep impact in me, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fathom why these people do the stuff they do when they don&amp;rsquo;t get any benefit out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a senior who took the time and effort to write a handwritten note for me about how he cherished the time together. I&amp;rsquo;ve had seniors text me things like how they missed me for gatherings. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a junior message me on days before exams when I was stressed, saying about how he the exams will be alright, because he has prayed for me.
These things I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, why do people do this to me. Do i really deserve this&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve not done any of them to others, I really feel blessed and grateful and a little confused about whether I really are worth the love, kindness and compassion people show to me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered why people why they does these, and often times, I think it&amp;rsquo;s how people are. Most of the times, people don&amp;rsquo;t do these just for me, they will be doing these small act of love/kindness to others as well, out of their own goodwill, but boy, does this give you such a good feeling. It gives you a feeling of warmth and enforces the feeling that you&amp;rsquo;re good too, that you are worthy too, to have someone spend time and effort to go the extra mile for you when they knew that they won&amp;rsquo;t be getting any extra points for good behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about why I haven&amp;rsquo;t done any of the above things.. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m selfish, or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I felt like doing any of the above mentioned things would make it cringe and the other person would consider me a weirdo or something, or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s both.
But once I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the receiving side, I never felt any cringe at all, all I felt was pure contentment, to feel that I&amp;rsquo;m worth too, that there are people out there who thinks I&amp;rsquo;m good too. I always remember feeling suddenly grateful, to feel happy that the actions I&amp;rsquo;ve done have made others feel good in such a way that they&amp;rsquo;re taking pains to make me feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord is great, This world is great, the people are great. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna start passing this onwards as well. Oh wait actually some small things which I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing in the past may be considered in these category as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve often times called any random person from my class whom I prolly won&amp;rsquo;t even be talking in real life, but chumma, simply I&amp;rsquo;ve called these people just to ask them hey, how do you do? These calls mostly happened during the COVID lowdown times and even though I won&amp;rsquo;t be having any topics which I could discuss, something or other would happen, and before I know it I would&amp;rsquo;ve been talking to this person for hoursðŸ™‚.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the times when I call someone after a good time, I usually ask them how they are and how they&amp;rsquo;ve been maintaining connections with their friends. The usual reply I get is that they sometime text each other, but other than that not much contact, so don&amp;rsquo;t know how things are going with each other. So this will prompt me to ask them to have a call and the response I get back almost always is about how they think they are not having anything to talk about, little knowing the fact that the call they&amp;rsquo;ve being doing with me for the past hour or so started with &amp;ldquo;hey, class okke engane pokunnu uvu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this calling people to talk really count as a selfless activity because these talks usually are fun and I like talking with people as well. One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve observed is that usually there are a lot of people who would be having a lot to talk about and you&amp;rsquo;d not be expecting these at all becuase they are usually so silent in class, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been at a lot of times, a listener for people to rant. And I don&amp;rsquo;t mean rant as in a bad kinda way, but in a way where people could just vent out their bottled up feelings freely without feeling that the other person(me in this case) would be judging them. Wow I&amp;rsquo;m lucky I think to have people trust me this m&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Linux Journey</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/my-linux-journey/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 02:33:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/my-linux-journey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Arch Linux with i3 tiling window manager. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the same laptop for the last 11 years. It&amp;rsquo;s been an eventful journey and was filled with a lot of learnings and grit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re someone who have used windows and then gradually switched to Linux by installing the distro yourself and fixing the issues yourself, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to relate a lot better than someone who got everything done to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beginning&#34;&gt;The beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 7th grade, I had to have surgery on my right knee. While I was in the hospital, my aunt came to visit me and gave me her old laptop to keep me entertained while I was laid up. It was a Dell Inspiron n4050 with both Windows 7 and Ubuntu pre-installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was pretty used to downloading English movies via torrent and watching them on my phone, so having a laptop was really convenient as I could transfer the movies and watch them on a bigger screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried using Ubuntu a few times, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really find anything appealing about it. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even open any of my games on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-school&#34;&gt;High School&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, I became even more interested in computers. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have regular internet access, so I had to use a net-setter to get online, but it was expensive and we could only afford to use it sparingly. I remember finding an app called NCERT solutions, which provided answers to questions in NCERT textbooks, and using it while in 8th grade. I also used to save APKs, ISO files, and web pages (by right-clicking and selecting &amp;ldquo;save as&amp;rdquo;) because of my limited internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got older, I started using my computer to create cool art and designs. At the time, I was really into Jarvis from Iron Man and I remember customizing my Windows 7 to look like Iron Man&amp;rsquo;s interface using RainMeter themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, I tried to delete Ubuntu from my system because I felt like it was taking up valuable space and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to press enter to select Windows from the dual-boot grub menu every time I wanted to use my computer. I was pretty comfortable with Windows and was familiar with system management (right-clicking on &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo; and selecting options). In the program, I saw that there were 70 gigs of space that were not being used by Windows. I thought this would be easy to fix, so I right-clicked on the partition and deleted it, then extended the Windows drive (C) to use the newly-created free space. Success! I thought, as I checked the properties of the C drive and saw that it had expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next day, when I tried to turn on my computer, I was greeted with a terrible grub error message. I had no idea what to do, since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t log into Windows anymore because deleting Ubuntu had broken something. I was really confused, because I had been able to fix any issues I had with Windows in the past, but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t Windows. This black screen with white letters seemed like something only hackers or coders could fix, right&amp;hellip;? And that&amp;rsquo;s where I would have given up. I asked my dad to take my laptop to a shop to be repaired, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t think laptops were that important for kids and told me to fix it myself since I was the one who broke it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;image src=&#34;//localhost:1313/images/linuxJourney/grubError.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The grub boot error message&#34;&gt;&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;p class=&#39;caption&#39;&gt;The infamous Grub rescue error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without my laptop, I was bored out of my mind, so I really wanted to fix it. We had an old Windows XP PC at home that was never used. I connected my dad&amp;rsquo;s phone to the PC, turned on USB tethering, and used that internet connection to search for solutions. After some searching, I found a way to fix it. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Windows 7 installation disk (since the laptop was a gift), I downloaded Hiren&amp;rsquo;s boot CD and, after 30 minutes of struggling, managed to get everything working again. Whew! I decided then and there that I would never use Ubuntu again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even during my 11th and 12th grade, I did all my C++ coding in Windows with Borland TurboC++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;college-life&#34;&gt;College Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major change began in my College life. During this time, Windows began really pushing and promoting Windows 10 a lot. I got free offers and tried installing on my Laptop, but then quickly had to uninstll them due to the computer being so slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I reached college, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 7 and urged everyone to move to Windows 10. Due to my slowness, I wanted to find a better alternative. . There was a FOSS club in our college which was very active and a senior over there suggested me to switch to Ubuntu (again) in my first year. I was reluctant,, but then agreed and tried installing it myself. I got it to work well, but the issue was slowness. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really find much better performance with the Ubuntu Gnome than Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling down and started looking at ways to speed up my system. This led me to a rabbit hole of exploring differrent Linux distros and seeing how I could get the best performance from my system.
Finally I settled on Xubuntu, a distro very similar to Ubuntu, but with XFCE as desktop environment. Now this was great for me. My RAM usage came to only 700-800 MBs in most idle times. I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transitioning&#34;&gt;Transitioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got introduced to the FOSS aspect a lot in my first year and i tried exploring them a lot and wanted to find foss alternatives to popular proprietirary windows softwre. and all of this took place in my first year.
I was scared to still delete windows asnd of&lt;/p&gt;
