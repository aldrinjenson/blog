      <title>Creating and embedding Subtitles for custom videos</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-create-and-add-subtitles-to-your-custom-video&#34;&gt;How to create and add subtitles to your custom video&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consists of the following steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-have-the-video-be-ready-at-hand&#34;&gt;Step 1: Have the video be ready at hand.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-brainer. But ensure that you have a video in which there is speech present. You can record the video using any web based recorders if you don&amp;rsquo;t have camera software installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in Mac, you can also record using QuickTime Player -&amp;gt; File -&amp;gt; New Movie Recording. This way you don&amp;rsquo;t need to use any other extra software than the ones already installed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux has a bunch of cli and GUI based free software available that you can use as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-download-whisper&#34;&gt;Step 2: Download whisper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whisper is state of the speech recognition model released by OpenAI.
There is both the original whisper python package and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp&#34;&gt;whisper.cpp&lt;/a&gt;.
Second one is highly recommended as it&amp;rsquo;s much more faster and optimised(cus it&amp;rsquo;s in C++ ðŸš€).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a good CPU, choose the medium model to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just install whisper by following the ReadMe instructions specific to your OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose the medium model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build the binary by running: &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-creating-an-wav-file-from-video&#34;&gt;Step 3: Creating an wav file from video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;rsquo;d need to convert the video file to an audio file to pass it on to &lt;code&gt;whisper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of writing this blog, whisper takes in only 16-bit &lt;code&gt;wav&lt;/code&gt; file as input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting the video to .wav is as easy as running this simple &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ffmpeg -i input.mov -ar &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;16000&lt;/span&gt; -ac &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will create a new file called &lt;code&gt;output.wav&lt;/code&gt; which contains just the audio from your video file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-4-generating-an-srt-file-using-whisper&#34;&gt;Step 4: Generating an srt file using whisper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pass in this audio file as input and generate subtitles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the subtitles generated are not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; great, just choose a bigger model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pass the &lt;code&gt;-osrt&lt;/code&gt; flag to generate the output as a &lt;code&gt;.srt &lt;/code&gt;file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the final command to achieve the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;./main -m  models/ggml-medium.en.bin ./output2.wav -osrt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will generate subtitles in the file &lt;code&gt;output2.wav.srt&lt;/code&gt; and place it in the same directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open this file and do some minor manual editing if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whisper is pretty good, but in some rare cases like for names, it may need some additional manual corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-5-encoding-the-subtitle-file-to-the-original-videooptional&#34;&gt;Step 5: Encoding the subtitle file to the original video(optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step involves creating a video which has the subtitles embedded inside.
This can be easily achieved using a simple ffmpeg script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf subtitles&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;output2.wav.srt final_with_sub.mp4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above script uses the &lt;code&gt;-vf&lt;/code&gt; flag to pass in the subtitle file. It generates the final output in a &lt;code&gt;.mp4&lt;/code&gt; format as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-6-boost-the-volume-of-videooptional&#34;&gt;Step 6: Boost the volume of video(optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason, you may want to increase the volume of the audio, you can achieve that also using ffmpeg with the -af param and passing the required audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf subtitles&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;output2.wav.srt -af &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;volume=1.3&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; final_with_sub.mov
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go. That&amp;rsquo;s all there is to adding custom subtitles to your videos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need for any proprietary fancy video editing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFMPEG FTW âœ¨&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organizing KochiFOSS 2022</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/organizing-kochifoss/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/organizing-kochifoss/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KochiFOSS 2022 conference was held on 15th October 2022 and from the participant&amp;rsquo;s responses, the conference was a huge success. I was lucky to be a part of the core organizing team. Jotting down my experiences and the lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experiences&#34;&gt;My experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worked on the KochiFOSS website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used Frappe framework
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was a pain to get started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But once the pattern was understood, then the future works were easy to manage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried bringing in a new guy from the tech team, but he had to suddenly leave which forced me to find a replacment quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had placments the two weeks before and after KochiFOSS
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adithya offerred to help out for a couple of days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I handled Twitter posts as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;ll be times when it&amp;rsquo;s better and safer to take a decision and go with the flow ASAP rather than taking time to analyze and think of all the pros and cons for taking a decision,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;ll be people from va&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;doubts-and-questions-i-have&#34;&gt;Doubts and questions I have&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do people volunteer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How being able to multi-task can be really useful at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The skill of management - keeping people happy and getting things done without hurting anyone&amp;rsquo;s ego.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adi&amp;rsquo;s message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>I gave a talk at an international conference and Murphy&#39;s law sucks!</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/i-gave-a-talk/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 19:09:07 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/i-gave-a-talk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an opportunity to do a Flash-Talk for IndiaFoss conference held in Bangalore on 23-24 July 2022 and boy, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy&#39;s_law&#34;&gt;Murphy&amp;rsquo;s law&lt;/a&gt; messed up my presentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;image src=&#34;//localhost:1313/images/indiaFoss/indiaFossTalk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My talk at IndiaFoss&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&#39;caption&#39;&gt;Excuse the 240p quality please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of my talk was: &lt;strong&gt;How to make sharing of digital assets as easy and accessible as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;
It was based on &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/projects/whatsapp-msg-without-save/&#34;&gt;an app I had made earlier&lt;/a&gt; to send messages by using the most common app in one&amp;rsquo;s phone - Whatsapp, without having to save anyone&amp;rsquo;s contact number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by a talk which I heard over at IndiaFoss from Akash Hamirwasia who made a web-app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://blaze.vercel.app/&#34;&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt; for sending files over the internet using a website.
His project was cool, but to me it seemed like the common man would find it a bit difficult. When I talk about the common man, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about they who doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know to open web browsers(Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people to whom when I asked to open browser, they have opened settings and searched &amp;ldquo;browser&amp;rdquo; in the settings search-bar. Just know that you are really privileged if you think such people don&amp;rsquo;t exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatsapp is the app with which people are most comfortable. If only there was a way to send files through whatsapp without having to save the contact number&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing my app which solves exactly this problem. It generates a wa.me link and opens it behind the scenes so as to trigger and open whatsapp chat of the person whose number has just been entered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-talk&#34;&gt;About the talk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So being inspired by Mr.Akash, I submitted my presentation and was selected to speak. I had been using Arch Linux for a while now and recently got a new laptop, but I was unsure if it would be able to connect to the HDMI port for the presentation. I saw others with ThinkPads easily connecting their laptops and presenting, so I thought Linux&amp;rsquo;s plug and play support would have me covered. Unfortunately, I was mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was given slot number 8 out of the 9 available slots, but by the time it was my turn, the participants had taken up more time than allotted and the event was running behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;et-tu-arch&#34;&gt;Et tu Arch..&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name got called, I went up and connected my laptop to HDMI cable only to find nothing being presentedðŸ¥².&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently my faith in Arch linux may have been a bit too much because had I bothered to check the status during some break maybe I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to face the difficulty.(Well technically, I tried doing that but then another speaker beat me to it and took a long time that I had to leave.. still..).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I was in front of the stage with my laptop not being able to present and the schedule already really late for me to get another&amp;rsquo;s laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I started speaking. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to take up more time and delay the program. So I talked about the problem, about my solution and about my app. I had this cool demo planned where I would call up someone from the audience and will send them a hi over Whatsapp without having to save their contact information, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it without being able to present. Still I talked and shared my idea. I had a bit.ly link which I asked everyone to enter to see a demo and url of github repo so that people could check out the project later as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterwords&#34;&gt;Afterwords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after I finished the talk and went to sit, a guy near me asked if I could make something similar for iOS as well to which I had to reply by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not having a macBook at present to compile and build for iOS even though I used Flutter to build the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I even left the hall, 3 people came near me and asked if I could build for iOS as well. I mean this is something magical about giving a talk I think. People know about your project and you get feedback instantly! I was happy to realize that the problem I solved was worthwhile and that many people found the solution good enough to be used!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I was speaking at such a large conference and it certainly gave a whole different feel. While I was sad that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t demo the presentation, I was happy that this would lead more people to benefit from my project.âœ¨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Whatsapp recently introduced a click to chat feature recently which would replicate the functionality of my app. You just have to pasta an unsaved number to some chat and then click it again within whatsapp to take you to the whatsapp chat of that person.&lt;/p&gt;
