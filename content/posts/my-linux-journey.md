description: An ode to my 10 year old laptop

I use Arch Linux with i3 tiling window manager. I've been using the same laptop for the last 11 years. It's been an eventful journey but was filled with a lot of learnings and grit.
P.S. If you're someone who have used windows and then gradually switched to Linux by installing the distro yourself and fixing the issues yourself, you'll be able to relate a lot better than someone who got everything done to them.

## The beginning

In my 7th standard, I had to undergo a surgery for my right knee. While I was in the hospital, my aunt visited me and gifted me her 1 year old laptop to kill my boredom while lying with my leg plastered. It was/is a Dell Inspiron n4050 laptop with windows 7 and Ubuntu pre-installed.

By that time I was pretty comfortable with torrenting English animation movies and watching them in phone, so getting a laptop was really nice and convenient as I could just transfer all the movies and watch it with my brother in a large screen.
Ubuntu was installed there for some Government of Kerala initiative. I tried using it once or twice, but couldn't really find any appeal as I found that I was not able to open any of my games in itðŸ¤·.

## High School

I used to like the computer very much. We didn't have internet so often. There was a net-setter which I could plug it into the computer to get internet, but that was expensive and hence would be charged only very rarely. I remember having found this app called NCERT solutions while in my 8th standard. I used to save all APKs iso files and even web-pages(right-click -> save as) because of the lack of a consistent internet connection. Once I reached high school, I used the computer for creating and using some cool artworks and designs. At that time I was very much fond of Jarvis from Iron Man and I remember having customized my Windows 7 to ook very much like an iron man feel using RainMeter themes.

During this time, I tried to delete Ubuntu from my system since I felt like this is wasted space and I didn't want to press enter for selecting windows from the dual-boot grub menu.
I was kinda good with Windows and was familiar with System management(right click my computer and select option). In the program, I saw that there were 70 gigs blacked out, meaning that Windows was not using this. Ahh. This would be easy I thought, as I right-clicked and deleted the partition. Then I extended the Windows drive(C) to use this newly created free space. Haa, success I thought as I found from C drive properties that my Drive has expanded.âœ¨
Piece of cake, I thought. THe problem became evident only on the next day when I tried to power on the machine and found this dreadful error message:

What the heck is GRUB, and what the heck does this error mean...

I had no idea, except that I can't login to windows anymore becuase deleting uBuntu broke something. I was really confused, because so far whatever issue I had faced in Windows, I was able to fix it somehow. But this was not windows. This is something else. This black screen with white letters seems to be what only hackers or coders can fix, right...?
And that's where I would have stopped trying. I asked my father to take it up to a shop and get it reparied, but he had other thoughts. He didn't think at that time that laptop for kids were that important and said we'll see about it in some time. If you want to use it, then fix it by yourself since it was you who broke it in the first place.

Now, without laptop, it was so boring, so I wanted to fix this thing somehow. We had an old Windows XP PC in our home which was never used. I connected my father's phone to this pc, turned on USB Tethering and with this internet, started seraching for answers. And soon enough I found a way. Since I didn't have Windows 7 installation Disk(as the laptop was a gift), I downloaded this Hiren's boot cd
