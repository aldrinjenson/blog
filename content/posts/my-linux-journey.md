I use Arch Linux with i3 tiling window manager. I've been using the same laptop for the last 11 years. It's been an eventful journey and was filled with a lot of learnings and grit.

If you're someone who have used windows and then gradually switched to Linux by installing the distro yourself and fixing the issues yourself, you'll be able to relate a lot better than someone who got everything done to them.

## The beginning

In 7th grade, I had to have surgery on my right knee. While I was in the hospital, my aunt came to visit me and gave me her old laptop to keep me entertained while I was laid up. It was a Dell Inspiron n4050 with both Windows 7 and Ubuntu pre-installed.

At the time, I was pretty used to downloading English movies via torrent and watching them on my phone, so having a laptop was really convenient as I could transfer the movies and watch them on a bigger screen.

I tried using Ubuntu a few times, but I couldn't really find anything appealing about it. I couldn't even open any of my games on it.

## High School

In high school, I became even more interested in computers. We didn't have regular internet access, so I had to use a net-setter to get online, but it was expensive and we could only afford to use it sparingly. I remember finding an app called NCERT solutions, which provided answers to questions in NCERT textbooks, and using it while in 8th grade. I also used to save APKs, ISO files, and web pages (by right-clicking and selecting "save as") because of my limited internet access.

As I got older, I started using my computer to create cool art and designs. At the time, I was really into Jarvis from Iron Man and I remember customizing my Windows 7 to look like Iron Man's interface using RainMeter themes.

During this time, I tried to delete Ubuntu from my system because I felt like it was taking up valuable space and I didn't want to have to press enter to select Windows from the dual-boot grub menu every time I wanted to use my computer. I was pretty comfortable with Windows and was familiar with system management (right-clicking on "My Computer" and selecting options). In the program, I saw that there were 70 gigs of space that were not being used by Windows. I thought this would be easy to fix, so I right-clicked on the partition and deleted it, then extended the Windows drive (C) to use the newly-created free space. Success! I thought, as I checked the properties of the C drive and saw that it had expanded.

But the next day, when I tried to turn on my computer, I was greeted with a terrible grub error message. I had no idea what to do, since I couldn't log into Windows anymore because deleting Ubuntu had broken something. I was really confused, because I had been able to fix any issues I had with Windows in the past, but this wasn't Windows. This black screen with white letters seemed like something only hackers or coders could fix, right...? And that's where I would have given up. I asked my dad to take my laptop to a shop to be repaired, but he didn't think laptops were that important for kids and told me to fix it myself since I was the one who broke it in the first place.

Without my laptop, I was bored out of my mind, so I really wanted to fix it. We had an old Windows XP PC at home that was never used. I connected my dad's phone to the PC, turned on USB tethering, and used that internet connection to search for solutions. After some searching, I found a way to fix it. Since I didn't have a Windows 7 installation disk (since the laptop was a gift), I downloaded Hiren's boot CD and, after 30 minutes of struggling, managed to get everything working again. Whew! I decided then and there that I would never use Ubuntu again.

Even during my 11th and 12th grade, I did all my C++ coding in Windows with Borland TurboC++.

## College Life

The major change began in my College life. During this time, Windows began really pushing and promoting Windows 10 a lot. I got free offers and tried installing on my Laptop, but then quickly had to uninstll them due to the computer being so slow.

By the time I reached college, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 7 and urged everyone to move to Windows 10. Due to my slowness, I wanted to find a better alternative. . There was a FOSS club in our college which was very active and a senior over there suggested me to switch to Ubuntu (again) in my first year. I was reluctant,, but then agreed and tried installing it myself. I got it to work well, but the issue was slowness. I couldn't really find much better performance with the Ubuntu Gnome than Windows.

I was feeling down and started looking at ways to speed up my system. This led me to a rabbit hole of exploring differrent Linux distros and seeing how I could get the best performance from my system.
Finally I settled on Xubuntu, a distro very similar to Ubuntu, but with XFCE as desktop environment. Now this was great for me. My RAM usage came to only 700-800 MBs in most idle times. I was happy.

## Transitioning

I got introduced to the FOSS aspect a lot in my first year and i tried exploring them a lot and wanted to find foss alternatives to popular proprietirary windows softwre. and all of this took place in my first year.
I was scared to still delete windows asnd of
