# Introduction

My thoughts after being an organizer for Technohack 2023

## Let's begin

- When the situation demands it, I can be a natural leader
- I find that it's always waaay easier to assign it to others and provide them with helpful suggestions
- When stressed, call for help
- Sometimes, you just need to take a decision and move forward 



## Backdrop

- Technohack was really good withe constraints
- It was done because of good managements and clear work distribution
- Events team is really useful
- Not getting stressed is really important
- Just approach everything with a sense of calmness
