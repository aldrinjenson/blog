Yes chatGPT is involved. But way lesser than you think.

## What happened

Inspiration randomly stuck and I wrote this poem within 2-3 minutes (Yes, I noted the time. It's definitely lesser than 4 minutes).

```md
Oh what is love,
but a fleeting romance
Oh, what is anger,
but a fleeting moment of rage..

Oh what is passion,
but a fleeting glimpse of action
Oh what is disgust,
but a fleeting moment of distate

Oh, in this world, what is real
but not a fleeting moment of emotion
Oh why do we care so much
for something that is fleeting..

Oh, for validation and appreciation
isn't worth the subjugation
Oh, for anger and annoyance,
isn't worth the pain

Everything is temporary
Everything is fleeting
Why hurt yourself
Trying so hard
in this fleeting world..
```

It's a short about the fleeting momentary thing in life, proving that in the end everything is fleeting, so why care so much about anything in particular.

Now, after a few hours, I randomly thought, why don't I just put it into chatGPT and see if it can improve. This was the prompt:

> This is a short poem I wrote in less than a minute about the fleeting momentary feelings of life, proving that in the end everything is fleeting, so why care so much about others. What do you think? How to improve? [Paste poem here]

This was the response:

> Your poem captures the essence of fleeting emotions and the transient nature of life. Here are a few suggestions to enhance it:

```md
Oh, what is love,
but a fleeting dance of hearts
Oh, what is anger,
but a fleeting storm that departs

Oh, what is passion,
but a fleeting flame that ignites
Oh, what is disgust,
but a fleeting shadow that bites

In this vast world, what is real,
but fleeting moments we borrow
Why then obsess and cling,
to what brings only sorrow

Validation and appreciation,
not worth sacrificing our worth
Anger and annoyance,
not worth the pain we unearth

Everything in life is transient,
like ripples in the wind
Why exhaust ourselves chasing,
what soon begins to rescind

Embrace the fleeting nature,
with a heart light and free
For in acceptance we find solace,
and true contentment shall be.
```

## Mind = Blown

I was blown away by the response. It rightly added rhyming schemes while correctly keeping the message of the poem.

I tried one more variation that was okayish, but nothing too spectacular as this one.

So I then took parts from both and rewrote some lines myself to finally I have this final piece that took all around 10 minutes in total, right from the writing phase. Here goes:

## Fleeting

```md
Oh, what is love,
but a fleeting dance of hearts
Oh, what is anger,
but a fleeting storm that departs

Oh, what is passion,
but a fleeting flame that ignites
Oh, what is disgust,
but a fleeting shadow that bites

In this vast world, what is real,
but fleeting moments we borrow
Why then hold on so tightly,
to what slips away so fast?

Validation and appreciation,
mere whispers in the breeze
Anger and annoyance,
like waves upon the seas

Everything in life is transient,
like ripples in the wind
Why exhaust ourselves chasing,
what soon begins to rescind

So embrace the fleeting nature,
with a heart light and free
For in acceptance we find solace,
and contentment shall ours be.

## Afterthoughts

I think this revolution of AI tools going on right now is awesome. I have never studied any formal music or song writing. In fact I have ever written only a handful of writings that can even borderline be close to a poem.

But now, I was able to jot down my ideas and chatGPT gave me a piece of writing that I am quite happy to share with others and convey the same feelings and ideas I wanted to convey with them.

<br/>

I asked chatGPT in a fresh chat instance to write a poem about: `the fleeting momentary feelings of life proving that in the end everything is fleeting, so why care so much about others`.

But this one turned out to be extremely different from the key aspects I came up with. Thus, my point being is that, with AI tools like chatGPT, the common man can now do things like an average trained person. Of course chatGPT can never make me a professional song writer (yetðŸ¤ž). There may be people who are more capable, but maybe chatGPT can give me average performance to proudly share my ideas as a poem or a literature work without being too embarrassed about conveying the idea through a poem at all due to the fear of being judged at the poor writing skills? Maybe, whatever teh case, I think this is a win for a poem written in just 10 minutes :)
