## Intro

I used to be someone who considers people as black and white - good and bad.
There are good people who are kind, helpful and overall nice. Then there are bad people who are the opposite.

However, right now, I don't think this approach is right.
No no. I am not saying there is a gray area for everyone. Instead I am just implying that the concept of classifying people based on their "niceness" or good-ness may be outright invalid. not wrong, but inapplicable

## The beginning

It all started with an epiphany after reading the first chapter of the famous Carneige book for finding friends where it said: Never Condemn, criticize or <> a person. You never know what they are going through.

After reading through all the principals shown in that chapter, I was able to relate a lot of my own life.
Surprisingly, I was able to relate to a lot of movie example as well!

1: take Cobra Kai series which is a sequel of the famous Karate Kid movies.
Quick recap: In Karate Kid, Daniel Larousso is a kid who is bullied for talking to a girl. He learns Karate from Miyagi and later beats the heck out of the bully and then getting the girl. We all cheered when at the end Daniel san did a crane kick and knocked down the bully. Cobra Kai continues this story and talks about how the life of bully John. From his perspective, Daniel is the foreigner who comes and takes his girlfriend away from him, and disgracing him in front of his master!
Most of would never have felt this way. We almost always side with the protagnoist of the story as the "hero". Those who are agains the protagonist will be "villains" and hence the bad guys.

2. Another example of bully actually not really being a bad guy. In the movie < of 2 brothers with brad as a boy innocent and dirk as dirk the jerk bully>

Many movies have been made where we see things from the "bad guy's" perspective and we would be able to relate to their actions as well.

3. Another example..

## Conclusion / Afterthoughts

Few questions may arise after reding through these.

1. Does this mean all people are saints?
   Nope. Just as all people cannot be labelled as bad, so can't they be labelled as good. Because, classifying "good"ness is not possible. same as "bad"ness is not possible.

2. Does this mean that we should trust everyone?
   Nope. I don't think so. After multiple instances where a person has let you down, maybe it would be wise to not encourage that person to do so again. There would be multiple reasons for that person to do so. The point is not criticize and label a person as bad just because of this reason. Move on. Don't argue

3. Don't argue.
   No good has ever come up by arguing. Sure you should explain your point of view. But make sure that you tell it by not considering the other person as someone who have done something terrible and hence you consider them as someone beneath you. Don't do that. It may surprise you to know that the other person may be having the exact feeling about you!.
