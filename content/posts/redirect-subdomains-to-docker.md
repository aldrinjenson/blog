## Introduction

Article on how to have multiple running docker containers (or any other web servers) and have separate subdomains which map to these services. 
<!-- Bonus tip on how to add https on these as well :) -->

## Requirements

1. A Linux machine on which you have docker containers running
2. SSH access to this Linux machine.
3. DNS management access.

## Steps

1. Start by installing a tool to manage a reverse proxy. nginx is a really good option.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Ensure that you can access your docker containers locally using curl/wget command.

3. Start running your services or docker containers to which you want to route traffic
```sh
cd <your_project_folder>
docker-compose up # or whatever other command you have assigned to start your server.
```

4. Find the port in which your container or services re running. Double check and ensure that the API is working fine in localhost, using the following commands

```sh
ss -lntp # check that the corredt port is exposed.
curl localhost:PORT # verify that you get the expected response.
```

5. Decide on the subdomains to which you want to route traffic and add them using your dns management console

Here's an example image using cloudflare
<center>
	<image src="/images/ssl/cloudflareDns.png" alt="Cloudflare DNS - Adding new subdomain"></image>
<p class='caption'>Cloudflare DNS - Adding new subdomain(replace the ip with your server's public ip)</p>
</center>

Note: You can get the public IP of your server using the following `curl` command

```bash 
curl ipinfo.io/ip
```

6. Once you add a subdomain in cloudflare, the next step is to ask nginx to route traffic from these subdomains to the docker services. This can be achieved by the following configuration in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`



```nginx
http {
   	server {
   	    listen 80; # replace with the line below if ssl support is added
#       listen 443 ssl;
   	    server_name subdomain.your-domain.com;

#    	    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/subdomain.domain.com/fullchain.pem;
#    	    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/subdomain.domain.com/privkey.pem;

   	    location / {
   	        proxy_pass http://localhost:9000;
   	        proxy_set_header Host $host;
   	        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
   	        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
   	        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
   	    }
   	}
}
```

The ssl_certificate fields are optional and need to be added only if you want to add https in your subdomain. For more details on adding SSL to your subdomain using `certbot`, checkout [this link](../set-up-ssl). 

Alright, that's it. Now you can navigate to http:<you_subdomain>.<your_domain_with_tld> to access your API.

You can add multiple subdomains and add other server blocks like above in nginx.conf file.
