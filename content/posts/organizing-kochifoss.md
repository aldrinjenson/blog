KochiFOSS 2022 conference was held on 15th October 2022 and from the participant's reponses, the conference was a huge success. I was lucky to be a part of the core organizing team. Jotting down my experiences and the lessons learned.

## My experiences

- I worked on the KochiFOSS website
- Used Frappe framework
  - was a pain to get started
  - But once the pattern was understood, then the future works were easy to manage
- Tried bringing in a new guy from the tech team, but he had to suddenly leave which forced me to find a replacment quickly.
- I had placments the two weeks before and after KochiFOSS
  - Adithya offerred to help out for a couple of days
- I handled Twitter posts as well

## Lessons learned

- There'll be times when it's better and safer to take a decision and go with the flow ASAP rather than taking time to analyze and think of all the pros and cons for taking a decision,
- There'll be people from va

## Doubts and questions I have

- Why do people volunteer?
