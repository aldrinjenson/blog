I had an exam today. It wak okay, but that's not what this post is about. This post is about the world we live in. Not the physical one with houses, trees, buildings and college, but the one which is more subtle and often times a bit hard to identify, the one filled with people, friends, laughter, rainbows and dewdrops.

I want to say about some people whose actions have really had a deep impact in me, because I couldn't fathom why these people do the stuff they do when they don't get any benefit out of them.

I have a senior who took the time and effort to write a handwritten note for me about how he cherished the time together. I've had seniors text me things like how they missed me for gatherings. I've had a junior message me on days before exams when I was stressed, saying about how he the exams will be alright, because he has prayed for me.
These things I don't understand, why do people do this to me. Do i really deserve this... I've not done any of them to others, I really feel blessed and grateful and a little confused about whether I really are worth the love, kindness and compassion people show to me.
I've often wondered why people why they does these, and often times, I think it's how people are. Most of the times, people don't do these just for me, they will be doing these small act of love/kindness to others as well, out of their own goodwill, but boy, does this give you such a good feeling. It gives you a feeling of warmth and enforces the feeling that you're good too, that you are worthy too, to have someone spend time and effort to go the extra mile for you when they knew that they won't be getting any extra points for good behavior.

I've thought about why I haven't done any of the above things.. Maybe it's because I'm selfish, or maybe it's because I felt like doing any of the above mentioned things would make it cringe and the other person would consider me a weirdo or something, or maybe it's both.
But once I've been in the receiving side, I never felt any cringe at all, all I felt was pure contentment, to feel that I'm worth too, that there are people out there who thinks I'm good too. I always remember feeling suddenly grateful, to feel happy that the actions I've done have made others feel good in such a way that they're taking pains to make me feel good.

The Lord is great, This world is great, the people are great. I'm gonna start passing this onwards as well. Oh wait actually some small things which I've been doing in the past may be considered in these category as well. I've often times called any random person from my class whom I prolly won't even be talking in real life, but chumma, simply I've called these people just to ask them hey, how do you do? These calls mostly happened during the COVID lowdown times and even though I won't be having any topics which I could discuss, something or other would happen, and before I know it I would've been talking to this person for hoursðŸ™‚.

Most of the times when I call someone after a good time, I usually ask them how they are and how they've been maintaining connections with their friends. The usual reply I get is that they sometime text each other, but other than that not much contact, so don't know how things are going with each other. So this will prompt me to ask them to have a call and the response I get back almost always is about how they think they are not having anything to talk about, little knowing the fact that the call they've being doing with me for the past hour or so started with "hey, class okke engane pokunnu uvu"

I don't know if this calling people to talk really count as a selfless activity because these talks usually are fun and I like talking with people as well. One thing I've observed is that usually there are a lot of people who would be having a lot to talk about and you'd not be expecting these at all becuase they are usually so silent in class, but I've been at a lot of times, a listener for people to rant. And I don't mean rant as in a bad kinda way, but in a way where people could just vent out their bottled up feelings freely without feeling that the other person(me in this case) would be judging them. Wow I'm lucky I think to have people trust me this m
