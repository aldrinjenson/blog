# Introduction
AWS Lambda is an easy way to set up APIs which you don't use regularly. The free tier from AWS is very generous (1 million requests per month). I personally found it to be a pain to find an easy way to setup a CI/CD workflow with it. After several hours, here is the approach I made myself to have a super easy way to set up a pipeline to Lambda.

# Steps
1. Initialise a nodejs application if you don't have one already
```bash
npm init
```
2. Install the packages `express` and `serverless-http`
```bash
npm install express serverless-http
```

3. In the index.js file, create an express app and export it 

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (_, res) => {
  res.send("Server active");
});

if (process.env.isDev) {
  app.listen(5000, () => console.log("listening on port 5000"));
}

module.exports = app;
```

4. Create a file called `lambda.js` which takes this exported app and converts the routes to lambda functions using `serverless-http` package.

```js
// lambda.js
"use strict";

const app = require("./index");
const serverless = require("serverless-http");

module.exports.handler = serverless(app);
```

5. Create a `serverless.yml` file like the one below. The service property can be renamed to anything you see fit.

There needs to be only one handler. Any routes created using standard express convention will be automatically configured as lambda routes using the filename as the endpoint slug.

```yml
service: express-to-lambda
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs16.x
  stage: prod
  region: ap-south-1
  memorySize: 512
functions:
  app:
    handler: lambda/lambda.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: /
          method: ANY
          cors: true
      - http:
          path: /{proxy+}
          method: ANY
          cors: true
```
NOTE: CORS is taken care by in the above yml. If you would require fine grained control, you can add fine-grained and programmatic CORS control using nodeJS middleware to handle it using your preference.

6. Deploy the functions

Deploying to AWS Lambda is super easy and can be done by the `serverless` nodejs library.
Run the following from the root directory of your project.
```bash
npm i -g serverless
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
# replace the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with your own values which can be received from AWS IAM 
serverless deploy
```


There you go. That's it. The above step may take some time, but with it, you would be able to deploy your express application with AWS Lambda.


# Bonus

Setting up CI/CD pipeline to deploy from a github repo is super easy as well. It can be achieved by creating a github workflow file like the one below:

```yml
# Place in .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: deploy to lambda

on:
  push:
    branches: main

jobs:
  lambda-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup node environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install serverless globally
        run: npm install -g serverless

      - name: Configure serverless authentication
        run: sls config credentials --provider aws --key ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }} --secret ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

      - name: Install npm dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Deploy lambda function
        run: sls deploy
```

Add the AWS values AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in github secrets and you're good to go. Now each time a new change is made and the code committed to the main branch, this workflow will run and the updated serverless function will be deployed to AWS Lambdaâœ¨


By the way, small tip - when doing local development, you can just add the following dev script in `package.json` to get live-reload as well.
```js
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "isDev=true nodemon index.js"
  }
```
Just run `npm run dev` the next time when developing locally.
