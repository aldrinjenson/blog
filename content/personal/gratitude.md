There are thing I have and there are things I don't. But the fact that I am here typing this out means I'm privileged. If you can read this in an electronic device, you're privileged too.

## Stuff I'm grateful for

- To be typing this out in a house on my own personal laptop
- To get loving and caring parents to whom I could turn to in times of confusion, worry and sadness.
- To have a great grandmother who instilled in me a sense of right and wrong.
- To have a laptop as a gift from an early age for me to tinker and explore a lot of things
- To go to a great Engineering college and be exposed to the wide and vast field of technology.
- To have made some great friends with whom I know I could call and share to them my joys and worries.
- To have been granted opportunities of leadership and team building

I think I have achieved a few things, but whatever I have it's all because of the one who strengthens me.

> I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
