A list of people whose selflessness and kindness has left a deep impact in my mind. These people never had to, bu still they took the effort to go the extra mile to do something for me. And it's never about me. They would have done it eitherways to any single person.
In this world where everything is being more and more transactionary, I am grateful to have met these few people who have shown so much kindness and selflessness.
