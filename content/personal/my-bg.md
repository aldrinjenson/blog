description: Stuff I have done and haven't done. What I'm proud of and my regrets.
---

This is a self reflective post. In my 20 years, I've had some experiences. However limited they be, I've been able to learn fro them. Hopefully as I grow older, I've also become a bit wiser. Here's my background.

I suffer from Imposter Syndrome. I've always been worried about posting anything on Social Media. But here am I listing out some my bg.

I am well aware that my experience is very limited, but with whatever awareness I'm having at the moment, here I am listing out stuff about me.

I've created softwares - big and small for personal joy or for startups and companies all using various languages ans stacks like:

- C/C++

  My first programming language. After learning python, found this really primitive and _useless_, but started liking it very much during Computer Networks class in 6th semester.
  Have made projects which involves:

  - Implementing tcp/udp connections
  - connecting with SQL databases
  - Making network calls
  - JSON parsing
  - socket programming (Made an IRC chat applications)

- Dart / flutter
  - Personally I'd say React Native and npm is a bit more nicer over Flutter and pub, but the tooling integration I find to be unbeatable
- GoLang

  Simple language, gave me huge respect and motivation to learn and research more about C language and it's origins.
  Have made only few CLI apps with it, but I want to one day be a part of some startup/company where Go is used as a major language

- Javascript

  The language I was most confident in for the longest time. Nowadays, I consider myself more of a generalist, but earlier, if there was something I wanted to get done as soon as possible, I knew I could always count upon JS and npm to let me do the thing. Whatever the problem I had to solve, I was confident and capable of doing it in Javascriptâœ¨

  - Node Js

    With the power of being able to do server side logic and show result in a webpage with a few lines of express code, this was a huge tool in my arsenal. (Python + Flask is really good too, but NodeJs was what I started out with).

    - streams
    - sockets
    - tcp connections
    - async/await
    - load balancing

  - React.Js / Next.Js
    - The library/framework which I've been really fond of. This took me places where I never saw myself ever wandering off.
  - React Native
    - Built several apps, [one of which](https://github.com/aldrinjenson/simple-stream) took several months, but is one I'm most proud of

- Java
  - Learned in College. We had a whole semester of Object Oriented Programming with Java.
  - Some of my friends had huge distate towards the languge, but I thought it was okay.
  - Loved the memes as well ;)
  - (I also used to joke around mimicking in Pirate voice: "Public static void main _AAAARGHSS_)
  - Made GUI apps using Swing, but didn't like the styling aspect of it much. Realized that JavaFX may be the way to go for building GUI stuff.
- Python

  Coming from a 12 th class C++ background, coding in TurboC++ of the late 1900s, python shocked me with the simple and clean syntax. I don't do much leetcode, but whatever CP problems I've done, I usually use Python only to quickly translate thoughts to code.

- Bash

  I've been using Linux for 4 years. Bash has been essential for a lot of [automation scripts I've made](https://github.com/aldrinjenson/scripts)

- Awk

  Really powerful text processing language. Learned for writing bash scripts. So powerful, yet so easy to use!

- Linux administration

  Been using Linux ever since I joined college and Arch has been my daily driver since second year. Think Linux is the best OS ever. With Linux, it's like you tell the computer what you want, and it does it. The level of customizations, scripting, automation you can do with Linux is so awesome!.

- Web dev

  During the late half of my first year, I was very much into front end development. I was really comfortable with Google's Materialize CSS framework. I was able to build websites really quickly and was in several clubs and communities for helping them build websites.

  - Html
  - CSS
  - Sass
  - Less
  - Materialize CSS / Bootstrap
  - Material UI
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Ember.Js
  - Foundation CSS
