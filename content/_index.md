My name is Aldrin and I'm a Final year Computer Science student from Govt.Model Engineering College Kochi, Kerala.

I'm really fond of computers and love tinkering with various softwares and hacks.
I have been using Linux as a daily driver for the last 4 years and have been loving it so far.

I used to consider myself really good at web technologies and proficient in React.Js. But now I don't like to call myself as a React/Javascript/NodeJs/Fullstack developer and instead would always prefer the title of Software developer, just because of the reason that I've come to terms that being a generalist - not being restricted to languages or tech stacks, but instead being good at fundamentals and concepts suits me much better.
