My name is Aldrin Jenson. I'm currently a final year student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Govt. Model Engineering College Kochi, Kerala.

I've been fascinated by computers from a really young age and love tinkering with various softwares and hacks.

I consider myself good at programming and I'm really passionate about developing software. Tech stack doesn't matter much to my anymore. Most of the projects I now work on is with the language or framework most easy to do the task at hand, or using a language I want to explore more.
With the amount of information available on the internet, given enough time I believe that we can solve any problem.

Other than tinkering with Computers, I also love playing guitar and going out with close friends.

This blog is an archive of some thoughts, experiences and learnings from my life - Writings which I can look back in a few years and feel _cringe_!
