        <div class="content e-content">
            <p>I use Arch Linux with i3 tiling window manager. I&rsquo;ve been using the same laptop for the last 11 years. It&rsquo;s been an eventful journey and was filled with a lot of learnings and grit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re someone who have used windows and then gradually switched to Linux by installing the distro yourself and fixing the issues yourself, you&rsquo;ll be able to relate a lot better than someone who got everything done to them.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>
<p>In 7th grade, I had to have surgery on my right knee. While I was in the hospital, my aunt came to visit me and gave me her old laptop to keep me entertained while I was laid up. It was a Dell Inspiron n4050 with both Windows 7 and Ubuntu pre-installed.</p>
<p>At the time, I was pretty used to downloading English movies via torrent and watching them on my phone, so having a laptop was really convenient as I could transfer the movies and watch them on a bigger screen.</p>
<p>I tried using Ubuntu a few times, but I couldn&rsquo;t really find anything appealing about it. I couldn&rsquo;t even open any of my games on it.</p>
<h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<p>In high school, I became even more interested in computers. We didn&rsquo;t have regular internet access, so I had to use a net-setter to get online, but it was expensive and we could only afford to use it sparingly. I remember finding an app called NCERT solutions, which provided answers to questions in NCERT textbooks, and using it while in 8th grade. I also used to save APKs, ISO files, and web pages (by right-clicking and selecting &ldquo;save as&rdquo;) because of my limited internet access.</p>
<p>As I got older, I started using my computer to create cool art and designs. At the time, I was really into Jarvis from Iron Man and I remember customizing my Windows 7 to look like Iron Man&rsquo;s interface using RainMeter themes.</p>
<p>During this time, I tried to delete Ubuntu from my system because I felt like it was taking up valuable space and I didn&rsquo;t want to have to press enter to select Windows from the dual-boot grub menu every time I wanted to use my computer. I was pretty comfortable with Windows and was familiar with system management (right-clicking on &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo; and selecting options). In the program, I saw that there were 70 gigs of space that were not being used by Windows. I thought this would be easy to fix, so I right-clicked on the partition and deleted it, then extended the Windows drive (C) to use the newly-created free space. Success! I thought, as I checked the properties of the C drive and saw that it had expanded.</p>
<p>But the next day, when I tried to turn on my computer, I was greeted with a terrible grub error message. I had no idea what to do, since I couldn&rsquo;t log into Windows anymore because deleting Ubuntu had broken something. I was really confused, because I had been able to fix any issues I had with Windows in the past, but this wasn&rsquo;t Windows. This black screen with white letters seemed like something only hackers or coders could fix, right&hellip;? And that&rsquo;s where I would have given up. I asked my dad to take my laptop to a shop to be repaired, but he didn&rsquo;t think laptops were that important for kids and told me to fix it myself since I was the one who broke it in the first place.</p>

<p class='caption'>The infamous Grub rescue error</p>
</center>
<p>Without my laptop, I was bored out of my mind, so I really wanted to fix it. We had an old Windows XP PC at home that was never used. I connected my dad&rsquo;s phone to the PC, turned on USB tethering, and used that internet connection to search for solutions. After some searching, I found a way to fix it. Since I didn&rsquo;t have a Windows 7 installation disk (since the laptop was a gift), I downloaded Hiren&rsquo;s boot CD and, after 30 minutes of struggling, managed to get everything working again. Whew! I decided then and there that I would never use Ubuntu again.</p>
<p>Even during my 11th and 12th grade, I did all my C++ coding in Windows with Borland TurboC++.</p>
<h2 id="college-life">College Life</h2>
<p>The major change began in my College life. During this time, Windows began really pushing and promoting Windows 10 a lot. I got free offers and tried installing on my Laptop, but then quickly had to uninstll them due to the computer being so slow.</p>
<p>By the time I reached college, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 7 and urged everyone to move to Windows 10. Due to my slowness, I wanted to find a better alternative. . There was a FOSS club in our college which was very active and a senior over there suggested me to switch to Ubuntu (again) in my first year. I was reluctant,, but then agreed and tried installing it myself. I got it to work well, but the issue was slowness. I couldn&rsquo;t really find much better performance with the Ubuntu Gnome than Windows.</p>
<p>I was feeling down and started looking at ways to speed up my system. This led me to a rabbit hole of exploring differrent Linux distros and seeing how I could get the best performance from my system.
Finally I settled on Xubuntu, a distro very similar to Ubuntu, but with XFCE as desktop environment. Now this was great for me. My RAM usage came to only 700-800 MBs in most idle times. I was happy.</p>
<h2 id="transitioning">Transitioning</h2>
<p>I got introduced to the FOSS aspect a lot in my first year and i tried exploring them a lot and wanted to find foss alternatives to popular proprietirary windows softwre. and all of this took place in my first year.
I was scared to still delete windows asnd of</p>
